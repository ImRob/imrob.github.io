Yesterday I met a family friend for lunch who had just finished a coding bootcamp and wanted to connect. I think I got more out of that coffee than I was able to give back. It was interesting to put myself in the shoes of a beginner again.

My coffee date wanted to know how do i keep up and what he should be learning next. I remember having that feeling of needing...no wanting...to know everything...now. I'm not sure if it's age or becoming more comfortable in my abilities, and not feeling bad at saying what i don't know, but i just felt sad. This guy felt he needed to know everything now in order to compete. He just graduated from a bootcamp. I get it, it's hard to tell someone who just spent 12 weeks and however many thousands of dolllars in a competitive immersive program to be patient. That's arrogant on my part.

One of my favorite voices in development is the team at 37 signals, and Jason Fried talks about it in a post called, 
[Just Give It 5 Minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes). So often in meetings, meetups and casual conversations there is a tendency to prove your technical prowess by always having something smart to say, by rattling off all the newest things you're playing with or contributing to. It's cliche but time is the most valuable and precious thing we have and yet we treat it as an infinite resource. (Just spend all weekend reading up on algorithms!..as if thats a great use of time for 80% of devs)

A few years ago I talked to a guy from a new fitness startup who mentioned that his company's product was written in Angular 1. The Angular team already gave word that they were doing a rewrite. I casually asked him how they'd manage the transition but couldn't really get an answer. Earlier this year I was at a meetup hosted by that same company and that same developer gave a talk about migrating their app from Angular to React. I'm not writing this to be an ass. No one can predict the future and you do the best you can today with the information you have today. Writing software is hard. I immediately thought of all the time invested and the duplication of effort, damn, again I felt sad.

Let's be honest. The time spent learning X means that you can't learn Y or can't meet Z who might be your future spouse, business partner, friend. It takes time for an idea or concept to really take hold in your mind. I'm always hesitant to present myself as the wise old fish, but my message to that new developer and to my younger self is to find calm in the chaos. Figure out what you want to create and then create it with whatever tools you have available right now (thanks Teddy Roosevelt). Focus on fewer, but bigger wins. Don't reach for a new view layer just because 'performance' or it works great with 'new thing from venerable startup'. Anything other than the task at hand is a distraction. Protecting your time will be the hardest thing you'll have to do as a programmer and cruelly it's a skill that takes time to develop.

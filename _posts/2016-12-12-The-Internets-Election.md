One re-occuring theme in modern history is man vs machine. The bronze age, the industrial revolution, mathematics the technological age etc. Every so often, man makes such breakthrough in learning that it's almost beyond his capacity to fully understand the new world in which he lives.

Usually this gap in understanding shows up in war. The Manhattan Project was a dream project for any ambitious physicist until they stepped back to really understand the scope of what they created. Suddenly the theoretical became real and everyone was forced to come to grips with the fact that man now had the means and methods to ending all life on earth.

Fast forward to today.

It's been an interesting time to be in tech. This election cycle was...*interesting*. I'm not going to get into politics, but rather the way news and data is being weaponized. I don't think many people realize how big automation and bots really are. I know I didn't until I worked in digital publishing and learned about programatic sales, automated bidding and the scope of user tracking. Think those posts in the comment section are from real people? It's becoming increasingly likely they are automated or paid trolls. Shit, you can't even get a concert ticket at face value anymore because an army of bots are beating you to the punch.

I didn't always care about privacy. I wasn't doing anything illegal, what should i worry about? But the amount of information that is available is staggering. This information can work in subtle ways. Someone knows that you're looking for a plane ticket, and probably also the days you really want to travel, they are probably charging you a premium for your ticket, see Vitaly Tsyvinski's excellent travel app. Or alerting potential employers that you are pregnant, or have small kids and making a judgement on your ability to contribute to the company before you even have an interview, or that you may have health issues that you prefer to keep private. Soon, employers will have an insane amount of data about applicants. I can't imagine the repercussions.

This election cycle saw a record amount of buzz around fake news, foreign actors and email dumps. Not to mention connected devices taking down some of the most robust websites on the planet. It's one thing when the internet explodes and gives us the crying Michael Jordan meme and occassional corporate email hack that spills all of Hollywoods gossip. But we may be moving past such rather innocent uses of its power, and I'm not even sure if there's anything we can do to stop it.

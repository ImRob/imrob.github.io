This is a slide library created to centralize the core functionality of a bunch of one off solutions in a UI.

**Why is this interesting or noteworthy**?

It's probably a right of passage in front end to create a slider, but with this one I wanted to think about the separations of concerns more clearly so that the slider could be updated in a way that didn't break already established functionality. 

One of the reasons I didn't go for an off the shelf solution was that our needs were unique enough that I would have spent as much time hacking around an existing solution than building my own.

**What were those unique issues?**

1. Exisitng HTML didn't conform to plugin scaffold. Design needed more flexibility.
2. We had to support left and right button navigation for users on desktop who were not able to scroll horizontally.
3. Not all teasers were of same size/offset. Notice example 3's 'View More' button.

**Bonus points**:
How do you stop an animated scroll event so that a user's interaction overrides the animated scroll event?...you pour some whiskey and cry.

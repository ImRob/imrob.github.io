title: About me 
---

This is my small corner of the internet where I keep my random musings on technology and code snippets. There's a ton of  talented people on the net cranking out great 'how to' material'. I'm not one of them. Instead I like to write about pragmatic ways of solving problems as I come across them in real world situations.
